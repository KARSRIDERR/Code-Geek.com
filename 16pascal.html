        Pascal is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Niklaus Wirth in the early 1970s. It was developed for 
        teaching programming as a systematic discipline and to develop reliable and efficient programs.

        Pascal is Algol-based language and includes many constructs of Algol. Algol 60 is a subset of Pascal. Pascal offers several 
        data types and programming structures. It is easy to understand and maintain the Pascal programs.

        Pascal has grown in popularity in the teaching and academics arena for various reasons:

        Easy to learn.
        Structured language.
        It produces transparent, efficient and reliable programs.
        It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms.
        Features of the Pascal Language
        Pascal has the following features −

        Pascal is a strongly typed language.
        It offers extensive error checking.
        It offers several data types like arrays, records, files and sets.
        It offers a variety of programming structures.
        It supports structured programming through functions and procedures.
        It supports object oriented programming.
        Facts about Pascal
        The Pascal language was named for Blaise Pascal, French mathematician and pioneer in computer development.

        Niklaus Wirth completed development of the original Pascal programming language in 1970.

        Pascal is based on the block structured style of the Algol programming language.

        Pascal was developed as a language suitable for teaching programming as a systematic discipline, whose implementations could be both reliable 
        and efficient.

        The ISO 7185 Pascal Standard was originally published in 1983.

        Pascal was the primary high-level language used for development in the Apple Lisa, and in the early years of the Mac.

        In 1986, Apple Computer released the first Object Pascal implementation, and in 1993, the Pascal Standards Committee published an Object-Oriented Extension to Pascal.

        Why to use Pascal?
        Pascal allows the programmers to define complex structured data types and build dynamic and recursive data structures, such as lists, 
        trees and graphs. Pascal offers features like records, enumerations, subranges, dynamically allocated variables with associated pointers and sets.

        Pascal allows nested procedure definitions to any level of depth. This truly provides a great programming environment for learning 
        programming as a systematic discipline based on the fundamental concepts.

        Among the most amazing implementations of Pascal are −

        Skype
        Total Commander
        TeX
        Macromedia Captivate
        Apple Lisa
        Various PC Games
        Embedded Systems

        <h2>Pascal - Environment Setup</h2>
      <pre>
    There are several Pascal compilers and interpreters available for general use. Among these are −

Turbo Pascal − provides an IDE and compiler for running Pascal programs on CP/M, CP/M-86, DOS, Windows and Macintosh.

Delphi − provides compilers for running Object Pascal and generates native code for 32- and 64-bit Windows operating systems, as well as 32-bit Mac OS X and iOS. Embarcadero is planning to build support for the Linux and Android operating system.

Free Pascal − it is a free compiler for running Pascal and Object Pascal programs. Free Pascal compiler is a 32- and 64-bit Turbo Pascal and Delphi compatible Pascal compiler for Linux, Windows, OS/2, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, DOS and several other platforms.

Turbo51 − It is a free Pascal compiler for the 8051 family of microcontrollers, with Turbo Pascal 7 syntax.

Oxygene − It is an Object Pascal compiler for the .NET and Mono platforms.

GNU Pascal (GPC) − It is a Pascal compiler composed of a front end to GNU Compiler Collection.

We will be using Free Pascal in these tutorials. You can download Free Pascal for your operating system from the link: Download Free Pascal

Installing Free Pascal on Linux
The Linux distribution of Free Pascal comes in three forms −

a tar.gz version, also available as separate files.

a .rpm (Red Hat Package Manager) version.

a .deb (Debian) version.

Installation code for the .rpm version::

rpm -i fpc-X.Y.Z-N.ARCH.rpm
Where X.Y.Z is the version number of the .rpm file, and ARCH is one of the supported architectures (i386, x86_64, etc.).

Installation code for the Debian version (like Ubuntu):

dpkg -i fpc-XXX.deb
Where XXX is the version number of the .deb file.

For details read: Free Pascal Installation Guide

Installing Free Pascal on Mac
If you use Mac OS X, the easiest way to use Free Pascal is to download the Xcode development environment from Apple's web site and follow the simple installation instructions. Once you have Xcode setup, you will be able to use the Free Pascal compiler.

Installing Free Pascal on Windows
For Windows, you will download the Windows installer, setup.exe. This is a usual installation program. You need to take the following steps for installation −

Select a directory.

Select parts of the package you want to install.

Optionally choose to associate the .pp or .pas extensions with the Free Pascal IDE.

For details read: Free Pascal Installation Guide

Text Editor
This will be used to type your program. Examples of few editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi.

Name and version of text editor can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad will be used on Windows and vim or vi can be used on windows as well as Linux or UNIX.

The files you create with your editor are called source files and contain program source code. The source files for Pascal programs are typically named with the extension .pas.

Before starting your programming, make sure you have one text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it and finally execute it.

        <h2>Pascal - Basic Syntax</h2>
        <pre>
            When we consider a Pascal program, it can be defined as a collection of objects that communicate via invoking each other's methods. 
            Let us now briefly look into what do class, object, methods, and instance variables mean.

        Object − Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behavior such as wagging their tail, 
        barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.

        Class − A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type supports.

        Methods − A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated 
        and all the actions are executed.

        Instance Variables − Each object has its unique set of instance variables. An object's state is created by the values assigned to these instance 
        variables.

        First Pascal Program
        Let us look at a simple code that will print the words Hello World.   

        Example
Live Demo
public class MyFirstPascalProgram {

   /* This is my first Pascal program.
    * This will print 'Hello World' as the output
    */

   public static void main(String []args) {
      System.out.println("Hello World"); // prints Hello World
   }
}
Let's look at how to save the file, compile, and run the program. Please follow the subsequent steps −

Open notepad and add the code as above.

Save the file as: MyFirstPascalProgram.Pascal.

Open a command prompt window and go to the directory where you saved the class. Assume it's C:\.

Type 'Pascalc MyFirstPascalProgram.Pascal' and press enter to compile your code. If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line (Assumption : The path variable is set).

Now, type ' Pascal MyFirstPascalProgram ' to run your program.

You will be able to see ' Hello World ' printed on the window.

Output
C:\> Pascalc MyFirstPascalProgram.Pascal
C:\> Pascal MyFirstPascalProgram 
Hello World
Basic Syntax
About Pascal programs, it is very important to keep in mind the following points.

Case Sensitivity − Pascal is case sensitive, which means identifier Hello and hello would have different meaning in Pascal.

Class Names − For all class names the first letter should be in Upper Case. If several words are used to form a name of the class, each inner word's first letter should be in Upper Case.

Example: class MyFirstPascalClass

Method Names − All method names should start with a Lower Case letter. If several words are used to form the name of the method, then each inner word's first letter should be in Upper Case.

Example: public void myMethodName()

Program File Name − Name of the program file should exactly match the class name.

When saving the file, you should save it using the class name (Remember Pascal is case sensitive) and append '.Pascal' to the end of the name (if the file name and the class name do not match, your program will not compile).

But please make a note that in case you do not have a public class present in the file then file name can be different than class name. It is also not mandatory to have a public class in the file.

Example: Assume 'MyFirstPascalProgram' is the class name. Then the file should be saved as 'MyFirstPascalProgram.Pascal'

public static void main(String args[]) − Pascal program processing starts from the main() method which is a mandatory part of every Pascal program.

Pascal Identifiers
All Pascal components require names. Names used for classes, variables, and methods are called identifiers.

In Pascal, there are several points to remember about identifiers. They are as follows −

All identifiers should begin with a letter (A to Z or a to z), currency character ($) or an underscore (_).

After the first character, identifiers can have any combination of characters.

A key word cannot be used as an identifier.

Most importantly, identifiers are case sensitive.

Examples of legal identifiers: age, $salary, _value, __1_value.

Examples of illegal identifiers: 123abc, -salary.

Pascal Modifiers
Like other languages, it is possible to modify classes, methods, etc., by using modifiers. There are two categories of modifiers −

Access Modifiers − default, public , protected, private

Non-access Modifiers − final, abstract, strictfp

We will be looking into more details about modifiers in the next section.

Pascal Variables
Following are the types of variables in Pascal −

Local Variables
Class Variables (Static Variables)
Instance Variables (Non-static Variables)
Pascal Arrays
Arrays are objects that store multiple variables of the same type. However, an array itself is an object on the heap. We will look into how to declare, construct, and initialize in the upcoming chapters.

Pascal Enums
Enums were introduced in Pascal 5.0. Enums restrict a variable to have one of only a few predefined values. The values in this enumerated list are called enums.

With the use of enums it is possible to reduce the number of bugs in your code.

For example, if we consider an application for a fresh juice shop, it would be possible to restrict the glass size to small, medium, and large. This would make sure that it would not allow anyone to order any size other than small, medium, or large.

Example
Live Demo
class FreshJuice {
   enum FreshJuiceSize{ SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE }
   FreshJuiceSize size;
}

public class FreshJuiceTest {

   public static void main(String args[]) {
      FreshJuice juice = new FreshJuice();
      juice.size = FreshJuice.FreshJuiceSize.MEDIUM ;
      System.out.println("Size: " + juice.size);
   }
}
The above example will produce the following result −

Output
Size: MEDIUM
Note − Enums can be declared as their own or inside a class. Methods, variables, constructors can be defined inside enums as well.

Pascal Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in Pascal. These reserved words may not be used as constant or variable or any other identifier names.

abstract    assert  boolean break
byte    case    catch   char
class   const   continue    default
do  double  else    enum
extends final   finally float
for goto    if  implements
import  instanceof  int interface
long    native  new package
private protected   public  return
short   static  strictfp    super
switch  synchronized    this    throw
throws  transient   try void
volatile    while       
Comments in Pascal
Pascal supports single-line and multi-line comments very similar to C and C++. All characters available inside any comment are ignored by Pascal compiler.

Example
Live Demo
public class MyFirstPascalProgram {
    ublic class MyFirstPascalProgram {

   /* This is my first Pascal program.
    * This will print 'Hello World' as the output
    * This is an example of multi-line comments.
    */

   public static void main(String []args) {
      // This is an example of single line comment
      /* This is also an example of single line comment. */
      System.out.println("Hello World");
   }
}
Output
Hello World
Using Blank Lines
A line containing only white space, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and Pascal totally ignores it.

Inheritance
In Pascal, classes can be derived from classes. Basically, if you need to create a new class and here is already a class that has some of the code you require, then it is possible to derive your new class from the already existing code.

This concept allows you to reuse the fields and methods of the existing class without having to rewrite the code in a new class. In this scenario, the existing class is called the superclass and the derived class is called the subclass.

Interfaces
In Pascal language, an interface can be defined as a contract between objects on how to communicate with each other. Interfaces play a vital role when it comes to the concept of inheritance.

An interface defines the methods, a deriving class (subclass) should use. But the implementation of the methods is totally up to the subclass.

What is Next?
The next section explains about Objects and classes in Pascal programming. At the end of the session, you will be able to get a clear picture as to what are objects and what are classes in Pascal.

            Object Oriented − In Pascal, everything is an Object. Pascal can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.

            Platform Independent − Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Pascal is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.

            Simple − Pascal is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Pascal, it would be easy to master.

            Secure − With Pascal's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.

            Architecture-neutral − Pascal compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Pascal runtime system.

            Portable − Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Pascal portable. Compiler in Pascal is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.

            Robust − Pascal makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.</div>

          <div>Pascal is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Pascal Programming:

            Object Oriented − In Pascal, everything is an Object. Pascal can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.

            Platform Independent − Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Pascal is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.

            Simple − Pascal is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Pascal, it would be easy to master.

            Secure − With Pascal's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.

            Architecture-neutral − Pascal compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Pascal runtime system.

            Portable − Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Pascal portable. Compiler in Pascal is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.

            Robust − Pascal makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.</div>
