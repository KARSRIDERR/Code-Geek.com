          Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by 
          Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). 
          This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language.

Why to Learn Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses 
English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.

Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development 
Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:

Python is Interpreted − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. 
This is similar to PERL and PHP.

Python is Interactive − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.

Python is Object-Oriented − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.

Python is a Beginner's Language − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide 
range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.

Characteristics of Python
Following are important characteristics of Python Programming −

It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.

It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.

It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.

It supports automatic garbage collection.

It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.

Hello World using Python.
Just to give you a little excitement about Python, I'm going to give you a small conventional Python Hello World program, You can try it 
using Demo link.

History of Python
Python was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late eighties and early nineties at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.

Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, and Unix shell and other scripting languages.

Python is copyrighted. Like Perl, Python source code is now available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

Python is now maintained by a core development team at the institute, although Guido van Rossum still holds a vital role in directing its progress.

Python Features
Python's features include −

Easy-to-learn − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.

Easy-to-read − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.

Easy-to-maintain − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.

A broad standard library − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.

Interactive Mode − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.

Portable − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.

Extendable − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.

Databases − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.

GUI Programming − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.

Scalable − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.

Apart from the above-mentioned features, Python has a big list of good features, few are listed below −

It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.

It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.

        <h2>Python - Overview</h2>
        <pre>    
        Python programming language was originally developed by Sun Microsystems which was initiated by James Gosling and released in 1995 
        as core component of Sun Microsystems' Python platform (Python 1.0 [J2SE]).

        The latest release of the Python Standard Edition is Python SE 8. With the advancement of Python and its widespread popularity, multiple 
        configurations were built to suit various types of platforms. For example: J2EE for Enterprise Applications, J2ME for Mobile Applications.

        The new J2 versions were renamed as Python SE, Python EE, and Python ME respectively. Python is guaranteed to be Write Once, Run Anywhere.

        Python is −

        Object Oriented − In Python, everything is an Object. Python can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.

        Platform Independent − Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Python is compiled, it is not compiled into 
        platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted
        by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.

        Simple − Python is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Python, it would be easy to master.

        Secure − With Python's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are 
        based on public-key encryption.

        Architecture-neutral − Python compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable 
        on many processors, with the presence of Python runtime system.

        Portable − Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Python portable. 
        Compiler in Python is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.

        Robust − Python makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.

        Multithreaded − With Python's multithreaded feature it is possible to write programs that can perform many tasks simultaneously. 
        This design feature allows the developers to construct interactive applications that can run smoothly.

        Interpreted − Python byte code is translated on the fly to native machine instructions and is not stored anywhere. T
        he development process is more rapid and analytical since the linking is an incremental and light-weight process.

        High Performance − With the use of Just-In-Time compilers, Python enables high performance.

        Distributed − Python is designed for the distributed environment of the internet.

        Dynamic − Python is considered to be more dynamic than C or C++ since it is designed to adapt to an evolving environment. 
        Python programs can carry extensive amount of run-time information that can be used to verify and resolve accesses to objects on run-time.

        History of Python
        James Gosling initiated Python language project in June 1991 for use in one of his many set-top box projects.
         The language, initially called ‘Oak’ after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office, also went by the name ‘Green’ and 
         ended up later being renamed as Python, from a list of random words.

        Sun released the first public implementation as Python 1.0 in 1995. It promised Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA), providing no-cost 
        run-times on popular platforms.

        On 13 November, 2006, Sun released much of Python as free and open source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).

        On 8 May, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of Python's core code free and open-source, aside from a small portion of code 
        to which Sun did not hold the copyright.

        Tools You Will Need
        For performing the examples discussed in this tutorial, you will need a Pentium 200-MHz computer with a minimum of 64 MB of RAM 
        (128 MB of RAM recommended).

        You will also need the following softwares −

        Linux 7.1 or Windows xp/7/8 operating system
        Python JDK 8
        Microsoft Notepad or any other text editor
        This tutorial will provide the necessary skills to create GUI, networking, and web applications using Python.

        What is Next?
        The next chapter will guide you to how you can obtain Python and its documentation. Finally, it instructs you on how to install 
        Python and prepare an environment to develop Python applications.

        <h2>Python - Environment Setup</h2>
      <pre>
    In this chapter, we will discuss on the different aspects of setting up a congenial environment for Python.

    Local Environment Setup
    If you are still willing to set up your environment for Python programming language, then this section guides you on how to download and 
    set up Python on your machine. Following are the steps to set up the environment.

    Python SE is freely available from the link Download Python. You can download a version based on your operating system.

    Follow the instructions to download Python and run the .exe to install Python on your machine. Once you installed Python on your machine, you will 
    need to set environment variables to point to correct installation directories −

    Setting Up the Path for Windows
    Assuming you have installed Python in c:\Program Files\Python\jdk directory −

    Right-click on 'My Computer' and select 'Properties'.

    Click the 'Environment variables' button under the 'Advanced' tab.

    Now, alter the 'Path' variable so that it also contains the path to the Python executable. Example, if the path is currently set to 'C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32', 
    then change your path to read 'C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32;c:\Program Files\Python\jdk\bin'.

    Setting Up the Path for Linux, UNIX, Solaris, FreeBSD
    Environment variable PATH should be set to point to where the Python binaries have been installed. Refer to your shell documentation, if you have 
    trouble doing this.

    Example, if you use bash as your shell, then you would add the following line to the end of your '.bashrc: export PATH = /path/to/Python:$PATH'

    Popular Python Editors
    To write your Python programs, you will need a text editor. There are even more sophisticated IDEs available in the market. But for now, 
    you can consider one of the following −

    Notepad − On Windows machine, you can use any simple text editor like Notepad (Recommended for this tutorial), TextPad.

    Netbeans − A Python IDE that is open-source and free which can be downloaded from https://www.netbeans.org/index.html.

    Eclipse − A Python IDE developed by the eclipse open-source community and can be downloaded from https://www.eclipse.org/.

    What is Next?
    Next chapter will teach you how to write and run your first Python program and some of the important basic syntaxes in Python needed for 
    developing applications.

        <div id="section3" class="sec">
        <h2>Python - Basic Syntax</h2>
        <pre>
            When we consider a Python program, it can be defined as a collection of objects that communicate via invoking each other's methods. 
            Let us now briefly look into what do class, object, methods, and instance variables mean.

        Object − Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behavior such as wagging their tail, 
        barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.

        Class − A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type supports.

        Methods − A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated 
        and all the actions are executed.

        Instance Variables − Each object has its unique set of instance variables. An object's state is created by the values assigned to these instance 
        variables.

        First Python Program
        Let us look at a simple code that will print the words Hello World.   

        Example
Live Demo
public class MyFirstPythonProgram {

   /* This is my first Python program.
    * This will print 'Hello World' as the output
    */

   public static void main(String []args) {
      System.out.println("Hello World"); // prints Hello World
   }
}
Let's look at how to save the file, compile, and run the program. Please follow the subsequent steps −

Open notepad and add the code as above.

Save the file as: MyFirstPythonProgram.Python.

Open a command prompt window and go to the directory where you saved the class. Assume it's C:\.

Type 'Pythonc MyFirstPythonProgram.Python' and press enter to compile your code. If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line (Assumption : The path variable is set).

Now, type ' Python MyFirstPythonProgram ' to run your program.

You will be able to see ' Hello World ' printed on the window.

Output
C:\> Pythonc MyFirstPythonProgram.Python
C:\> Python MyFirstPythonProgram 
Hello World
Basic Syntax
About Python programs, it is very important to keep in mind the following points.

Case Sensitivity − Python is case sensitive, which means identifier Hello and hello would have different meaning in Python.

Class Names − For all class names the first letter should be in Upper Case. If several words are used to form a name of the class, each inner word's first letter should be in Upper Case.

Example: class MyFirstPythonClass

Method Names − All method names should start with a Lower Case letter. If several words are used to form the name of the method, then each inner word's first letter should be in Upper Case.

Example: public void myMethodName()

Program File Name − Name of the program file should exactly match the class name.

When saving the file, you should save it using the class name (Remember Python is case sensitive) and append '.Python' to the end of the name (if the file name and the class name do not match, your program will not compile).

But please make a note that in case you do not have a public class present in the file then file name can be different than class name. It is also not mandatory to have a public class in the file.

Example: Assume 'MyFirstPythonProgram' is the class name. Then the file should be saved as 'MyFirstPythonProgram.Python'

public static void main(String args[]) − Python program processing starts from the main() method which is a mandatory part of every Python program.

Python Identifiers
All Python components require names. Names used for classes, variables, and methods are called identifiers.

In Python, there are several points to remember about identifiers. They are as follows −

All identifiers should begin with a letter (A to Z or a to z), currency character ($) or an underscore (_).

After the first character, identifiers can have any combination of characters.

A key word cannot be used as an identifier.

Most importantly, identifiers are case sensitive.

Examples of legal identifiers: age, $salary, _value, __1_value.

Examples of illegal identifiers: 123abc, -salary.

Python Modifiers
Like other languages, it is possible to modify classes, methods, etc., by using modifiers. There are two categories of modifiers −

Access Modifiers − default, public , protected, private

Non-access Modifiers − final, abstract, strictfp

We will be looking into more details about modifiers in the next section.

Python Variables
Following are the types of variables in Python −

Local Variables
Class Variables (Static Variables)
Instance Variables (Non-static Variables)
Python Arrays
Arrays are objects that store multiple variables of the same type. However, an array itself is an object on the heap. We will look into how to declare, construct, and initialize in the upcoming chapters.

Python Enums
Enums were introduced in Python 5.0. Enums restrict a variable to have one of only a few predefined values. The values in this enumerated list are called enums.

With the use of enums it is possible to reduce the number of bugs in your code.

For example, if we consider an application for a fresh juice shop, it would be possible to restrict the glass size to small, medium, and large. This would make sure that it would not allow anyone to order any size other than small, medium, or large.

Example
Live Demo
class FreshJuice {
   enum FreshJuiceSize{ SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE }
   FreshJuiceSize size;
}

public class FreshJuiceTest {

   public static void main(String args[]) {
      FreshJuice juice = new FreshJuice();
      juice.size = FreshJuice.FreshJuiceSize.MEDIUM ;
      System.out.println("Size: " + juice.size);
   }
}
The above example will produce the following result −

Output
Size: MEDIUM
Note − Enums can be declared as their own or inside a class. Methods, variables, constructors can be defined inside enums as well.

Python Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in Python. These reserved words may not be used as constant or variable or any other identifier names.

abstract    assert  boolean break
byte    case    catch   char
class   const   continue    default
do  double  else    enum
extends final   finally float
for goto    if  implements
import  instanceof  int interface
long    native  new package
private protected   public  return
short   static  strictfp    super
switch  synchronized    this    throw
throws  transient   try void
volatile    while       
Comments in Python
Python supports single-line and multi-line comments very similar to C and C++. All characters available inside any comment are ignored by Python compiler.

Example
Live Demo
public class MyFirstPythonProgram {
    ublic class MyFirstPythonProgram {

   /* This is my first Python program.
    * This will print 'Hello World' as the output
    * This is an example of multi-line comments.
    */

   public static void main(String []args) {
      // This is an example of single line comment
      /* This is also an example of single line comment. */
      System.out.println("Hello World");
   }
}
Output
Hello World
Using Blank Lines
A line containing only white space, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and Python totally ignores it.

Inheritance
In Python, classes can be derived from classes. Basically, if you need to create a new class and here is already a class that has some of the code you require, then it is possible to derive your new class from the already existing code.

This concept allows you to reuse the fields and methods of the existing class without having to rewrite the code in a new class. In this scenario, the existing class is called the superclass and the derived class is called the subclass.

Interfaces
In Python language, an interface can be defined as a contract between objects on how to communicate with each other. Interfaces play a vital role when it comes to the concept of inheritance.

An interface defines the methods, a deriving class (subclass) should use. But the implementation of the methods is totally up to the subclass.

What is Next?
The next section explains about Objects and classes in Python programming. At the end of the session, you will be able to get a clear picture as to what are objects and what are classes in Python.

          <div>Python is a high-level programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. Python runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. This tutorial gives a complete understanding of Python. This reference will take you through simple and practical approaches while learning Python Programming language.</div>
          <h2>Why to Learn Python Programming?</h2>
          <div>Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python Programming:

            Object Oriented − In Python, everything is an Object. Python can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.

            Platform Independent − Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Python is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.

            Simple − Python is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Python, it would be easy to master.

            Secure − With Python's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.

            Architecture-neutral − Python compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Python runtime system.

            Portable − Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Python portable. Compiler in Python is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.
