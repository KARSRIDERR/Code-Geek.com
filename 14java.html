          <div>Java is a high-level programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. Java runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. This tutorial gives a complete understanding of Java. This reference will take you through simple and practical approaches while learning Java Programming language.</div>
          <h2>Why to Learn java Programming?</h2>
          <div>Java is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Java Programming:

            Object Oriented − In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.

            Platform Independent − Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.

            Simple − Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.

            Secure − With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.

            Architecture-neutral − Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.

            Portable − Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable. Compiler in Java is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.

            Robust − Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.</div>
            <h2>Hello World using Java Programming.</h2>
          <div>Just to give you a little excitement about Java programming, I'm going to give you a small conventional C Programming Hello World program, You can try it using Demo link.</div>
          <pre>
              public class MyFirstJavaProgram {
                /* This is my first java program.
                * This will print 'Hello World' as the output
                */

               public static void main(String []args) {
                  System.out.println("Hello World"); // prints Hello World

            Applications of Java Programming
            The latest release of the Java Standard Edition is Java SE 8. With the advancement of Java and its widespread popularity, multiple 
            configurations were built to suit various types of platforms. For example: J2EE for Enterprise Applications, J2ME for Mobile Applications.

            The new J2 versions were renamed as Java SE, Java EE, and Java ME respectively. Java is guaranteed to be Write Once, Run Anywhere.

            Multithreaded − With Java's multithreaded feature it is possible to write programs that can perform many tasks simultaneously. 
            This design feature allows the developers to construct interactive applications that can run smoothly.

            Interpreted − Java byte code is translated on the fly to native machine instructions and is not stored anywhere. 
            The development process is more rapid and analytical since the linking is an incremental and light-weight process.

            High Performance − With the use of Just-In-Time compilers, Java enables high performance.

            Distributed − Java is designed for the distributed environment of the internet.

            Dynamic − Java is considered to be more dynamic than C or C++ since it is designed to adapt to an evolving environment. 
            Java programs can carry extensive amount of run-time information that can be used to verify and resolve accesses to objects on run-time.

            Audience
            This tutorial has been prepared for the beginners to help them understand the basic to advanced concepts related to Java Programming language.

        History of Java
        James Gosling initiated Java language project in June 1991 for use in one of his many set-top box projects.
         The language, initially called ‘Oak’ after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office, also went by the name ‘Green’ and 
         ended up later being renamed as Java, from a list of random words.

        Sun released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1995. It promised Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA), providing no-cost 
        run-times on popular platforms.

        On 13 November, 2006, Sun released much of Java as free and open source software under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).

        On 8 May, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of Java's core code free and open-source, aside from a small portion of code 
        to which Sun did not hold the copyright.

        Tools You Will Need

        <h2>Java - Environment Setup</h2>
      <pre>
    In this chapter, we will discuss on the different aspects of setting up a congenial environment for Java.

    Local Environment Setup
    If you are still willing to set up your environment for Java programming language, then this section guides you on how to download and 
    set up Java on your machine. Following are the steps to set up the environment.

    Java SE is freely available from the link Download Java. You can download a version based on your operating system.

    Follow the instructions to download Java and run the .exe to install Java on your machine. Once you installed Java on your machine, you will 
    need to set environment variables to point to correct installation directories −

    Setting Up the Path for Windows
    Assuming you have installed Java in c:\Program Files\java\jdk directory −

    Right-click on 'My Computer' and select 'Properties'.

    Click the 'Environment variables' button under the 'Advanced' tab.

    Now, alter the 'Path' variable so that it also contains the path to the Java executable. Example, if the path is currently set to 'C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32', 
    then change your path to read 'C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32;c:\Program Files\java\jdk\bin'.

    Setting Up the Path for Linux, UNIX, Solaris, FreeBSD
    Environment variable PATH should be set to point to where the Java binaries have been installed. Refer to your shell documentation, if you have 
    trouble doing this.

    Example, if you use bash as your shell, then you would add the following line to the end of your '.bashrc: export PATH = /path/to/java:$PATH'

    Popular Java Editors
    To write your Java programs, you will need a text editor. There are even more sophisticated IDEs available in the market. But for now, 
    you can consider one of the following −

    Notepad − On Windows machine, you can use any simple text editor like Notepad (Recommended for this tutorial), TextPad.

    Netbeans − A Java IDE that is open-source and free which can be downloaded from https://www.netbeans.org/index.html.

    Eclipse − A Java IDE developed by the eclipse open-source community and can be downloaded from https://www.eclipse.org/.

    What is Next?
    Next chapter will teach you how to write and run your first Java program and some of the important basic syntaxes in Java needed for 
    developing applications.     
      </pre>
      </div>

        <div id="section3" class="sec">
        <h2>Java - Basic Syntax</h2>
        <pre>
            When we consider a Java program, it can be defined as a collection of objects that communicate via invoking each other's methods. 
            Let us now briefly look into what do class, object, methods, and instance variables mean.

        Object − Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behavior such as wagging their tail, 
        barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.

        Class − A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type supports.

        Methods − A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated 
        and all the actions are executed.

        Instance Variables − Each object has its unique set of instance variables. An object's state is created by the values assigned to these instance 
        variables.

        First Java Program
        Let us look at a simple code that will print the words Hello World.   

        Example
Live Demo
public class MyFirstJavaProgram {

   /* This is my first java program.
    * This will print 'Hello World' as the output
    */

   public static void main(String []args) {
      System.out.println("Hello World"); // prints Hello World
   }
}
Let's look at how to save the file, compile, and run the program. Please follow the subsequent steps −

Open notepad and add the code as above.

Save the file as: MyFirstJavaProgram.java.

Open a command prompt window and go to the directory where you saved the class. Assume it's C:\.

Type 'javac MyFirstJavaProgram.java' and press enter to compile your code. If there are no errors in your code, the command prompt will take you to the next line (Assumption : The path variable is set).

Now, type ' java MyFirstJavaProgram ' to run your program.

You will be able to see ' Hello World ' printed on the window.

Output
C:\> javac MyFirstJavaProgram.java
C:\> java MyFirstJavaProgram 
Hello World
Basic Syntax
About Java programs, it is very important to keep in mind the following points.

Case Sensitivity − Java is case sensitive, which means identifier Hello and hello would have different meaning in Java.

Class Names − For all class names the first letter should be in Upper Case. If several words are used to form a name of the class, each inner word's first letter should be in Upper Case.

Example: class MyFirstJavaClass

Method Names − All method names should start with a Lower Case letter. If several words are used to form the name of the method, then each inner word's first letter should be in Upper Case.

Example: public void myMethodName()

Program File Name − Name of the program file should exactly match the class name.

When saving the file, you should save it using the class name (Remember Java is case sensitive) and append '.java' to the end of the name (if the file name and the class name do not match, your program will not compile).

But please make a note that in case you do not have a public class present in the file then file name can be different than class name. It is also not mandatory to have a public class in the file.

Example: Assume 'MyFirstJavaProgram' is the class name. Then the file should be saved as 'MyFirstJavaProgram.java'

public static void main(String args[]) − Java program processing starts from the main() method which is a mandatory part of every Java program.

Java Identifiers
All Java components require names. Names used for classes, variables, and methods are called identifiers.

In Java, there are several points to remember about identifiers. They are as follows −

All identifiers should begin with a letter (A to Z or a to z), currency character ($) or an underscore (_).

After the first character, identifiers can have any combination of characters.

A key word cannot be used as an identifier.

Most importantly, identifiers are case sensitive.

Examples of legal identifiers: age, $salary, _value, __1_value.

Examples of illegal identifiers: 123abc, -salary.

Java Modifiers
Like other languages, it is possible to modify classes, methods, etc., by using modifiers. There are two categories of modifiers −

Access Modifiers − default, public , protected, private

Non-access Modifiers − final, abstract, strictfp

We will be looking into more details about modifiers in the next section.

Java Variables
Following are the types of variables in Java −

Local Variables
Class Variables (Static Variables)
Instance Variables (Non-static Variables)
Java Arrays
Arrays are objects that store multiple variables of the same type. However, an array itself is an object on the heap. We will look into how to declare, construct, and initialize in the upcoming chapters.

Java Enums
Enums were introduced in Java 5.0. Enums restrict a variable to have one of only a few predefined values. The values in this enumerated list are called enums.

With the use of enums it is possible to reduce the number of bugs in your code.

For example, if we consider an application for a fresh juice shop, it would be possible to restrict the glass size to small, medium, and large. This would make sure that it would not allow anyone to order any size other than small, medium, or large.

Example
Live Demo
class FreshJuice {
   enum FreshJuiceSize{ SMALL, MEDIUM, LARGE }
   FreshJuiceSize size;
}

public class FreshJuiceTest {

   public static void main(String args[]) {
      FreshJuice juice = new FreshJuice();
      juice.size = FreshJuice.FreshJuiceSize.MEDIUM ;
      System.out.println("Size: " + juice.size);
   }
}
The above example will produce the following result −

Output
Size: MEDIUM
Note − Enums can be declared as their own or inside a class. Methods, variables, constructors can be defined inside enums as well.

Java Keywords
The following list shows the reserved words in Java. These reserved words may not be used as constant or variable or any other identifier names.

abstract    assert  boolean break
byte    case    catch   char
class   const   continue    default
do  double  else    enum
extends final   finally float
for goto    if  implements
import  instanceof  int interface
long    native  new package
private protected   public  return
short   static  strictfp    super
switch  synchronized    this    throw
throws  transient   try void
volatile    while       
Comments in Java
Java supports single-line and multi-line comments very similar to C and C++. All characters available inside any comment are ignored by Java compiler.

Example
Live Demo
public class MyFirstJavaProgram {
    ublic class MyFirstJavaProgram {

   /* This is my first java program.
    * This will print 'Hello World' as the output
    * This is an example of multi-line comments.
    */

   public static void main(String []args) {
      // This is an example of single line comment
      /* This is also an example of single line comment. */
      System.out.println("Hello World");
   }
}
Output
Hello World
Using Blank Lines
A line containing only white space, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and Java totally ignores it.

Inheritance
In Java, classes can be derived from classes. Basically, if you need to create a new class and here is already a class that has some of the code you require, then it is possible to derive your new class from the already existing code.

This concept allows you to reuse the fields and methods of the existing class without having to rewrite the code in a new class. In this scenario, the existing class is called the superclass and the derived class is called the subclass.

Interfaces
In Java language, an interface can be defined as a contract between objects on how to communicate with each other. Interfaces play a vital role when it comes to the concept of inheritance.

An interface defines the methods, a deriving class (subclass) should use. But the implementation of the methods is totally up to the subclass.

What is Next?
The next section explains about Objects and classes in Java programming. At the end of the session, you will be able to get a clear picture as to what are objects and what are classes in Java.

        <h2>Java - Object and Classes</h2>
          <pre>
             Java is an Object-Oriented Language. As a language that has the Object-Oriented feature, Java supports the following fundamental concepts −

            Polymorphism
            Inheritance
            Encapsulation
            Abstraction
            Classes
            Objects
            Instance
            Method
            Message Passing
            In this chapter, we will look into the concepts - Classes and Objects.

            Object − Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors – wagging the tail, 
            barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.

            Class − A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type support.

            Objects in Java
            Let us now look deep into what are objects. If we consider the real-world, we can find many objects around us, cars, dogs, humans, 
            etc. All these objects have a state and a behavior.

            If we consider a dog, then its state is - name, breed, color, and the behavior is - barking, wagging the tail, running.

            If you compare the software object with a real-world object, they have very similar characteristics.

            Software objects also have a state and a behavior. A software object's state is stored in fields and behavior is shown via methods.

            So in software development, methods operate on the internal state of an object and the object-to-object communication is done via methods.

            Classes in Java
            A class is a blueprint from which individual objects are created.

            Following is a sample of a class.

            Example
            public class Dog {
               String breed;
               int age;
               String color;

               void barking() {
               }

               void hungry() {
               }

               void sleeping() {
               }
            }
            A class can contain any of the following variable types.

            Local variables − Variables defined inside methods, constructors or blocks are called local variables. The variable will be declared and initialized within the method and the variable will be destroyed when the method has completed.

            Instance variables − Instance variables are variables within a class but outside any method. These variables are initialized when the 
            class is instantiated. Instance variables can be accessed from inside any method, constructor or blocks of that particular class.

            Class variables − Class variables are variables declared within a class, outside any method, with the static keyword.

            A class can have any number of methods to access the value of various kinds of methods. In the above example, barking(), hungry() and 
            sleeping() are methods.

            Following are some of the important topics that need to be discussed when looking into classes of the Java Language.

            Constructors
            When discussing about classes, one of the most important sub topic would be constructors. Every class has a constructor. If we do not 
            explicitly write a constructor for a class, the Java compiler builds a default constructor for that class.

            Each time a new object is created, at least one constructor will be invoked. The main rule of constructors is that they should have the 
            same name as the class. A class can have more than one constructor.

            Following is an example of a constructor −
          </pre>
            </div>

            <div id="section5" class="sec">
            <h2>Java - Constructors</h2>
            A constructor initializes an object when it is created. It has the same name as its class and is syntactically similar to a method. 
            However, constructors have no explicit return type.

            Typically, you will use a constructor to give initial values to the instance variables defined by the class, or to perform any other 
            start-up procedures required to create a fully formed object.

            All classes have constructors, whether you define one or not, because Java automatically provides a default constructor that initializes 
            all member variables to zero. However, once you define your own constructor, the default constructor is no longer used.
            Syntax
            Following is the syntax of a constructor −

            class ClassName {
               ClassName() {
               }
            }
            Java allows two types of constructors namely −

            No argument Constructors
            Parameterized Constructors
            No argument Constructors
            As the name specifies the no argument constructors of Java does not accept any parameters instead, using these constructors 
            the instance variables of a method will be initialized with fixed values for all objects.
            Example
            Public class MyClass {
               Int num;
               MyClass() {
                  num = 100;
               }
            }
            You would call constructor to initialize objects as follows

            public class ConsDemo {
               public static void main(String args[]) {
                  MyClass t1 = new MyClass();
                  MyClass t2 = new MyClass();
                  System.out.println(t1.num + " " + t2.num);
               }
            }
            This would produce the following result

            100 100
            Parameterized Constructors
            Most often, you will need a constructor that accepts one or more parameters. Parameters are added to a constructor in the same 
            way that they are added to a method, just declare them inside the parentheses after the constructor's name.

             <h2>Java - Basic Datatypes</h2>
             <pre>
                Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in the memory.

Based on the data type of a variable, the operating system allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables, you can store integers, decimals, or characters in these variables.

There are two data types available in Java −

Primitive Data Types
Reference/Object Data Types
Primitive Data Types
There are eight primitive datatypes supported by Java. Primitive datatypes are predefined by the language and named by a keyword. Let us now look into the eight primitive data types in detail.

byte
Byte data type is an 8-bit signed two's complement integer

Minimum value is -128 (-2^7)

Maximum value is 127 (inclusive)(2^7 -1)

Default value is 0

Byte data type is used to save space in large arrays, mainly in place of integers, since a byte is four times smaller than an integer.

Example: byte a = 100, byte b = -50

short
Short data type is a 16-bit signed two's complement integer

Minimum value is -32,768 (-2^15)

Maximum value is 32,767 (inclusive) (2^15 -1)

Short data type can also be used to save memory as byte data type. A short is 2 times smaller than an integer

Default value is 0.

Example: short s = 10000, short r = -20000

int
Int data type is a 32-bit signed two's complement integer.

Minimum value is - 2,147,483,648 (-2^31)

Maximum value is 2,147,483,647(inclusive) (2^31 -1)

Integer is generally used as the default data type for integral values unless there is a concern about memory.

The default value is 0

Example: int a = 100000, int b = -200000

long
Long data type is a 64-bit signed two's complement integer
Minimum value is -9,223,372,036,854,775,808(-2^63)
Maximum value is 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 (inclusive)(2^63 -1)
This type is used when a wider range than int is needed
Default value is 0L
Example: long a = 100000L, long b = -200000L
float
Float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point

Float is mainly used to save memory in large arrays of floating point numbers

Default value is 0.0f

Float data type is never used for precise values such as currency

Example: float f1 = 234.5f

double
double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point

This data type is generally used as the default data type for decimal values, generally the default choice

Double data type should never be used for precise values such as currency

Default value is 0.0d

Example: double d1 = 123.4

boolean
boolean data type represents one bit of information
There are only two possible values: true and false
This data type is used for simple flags that track true/false conditions
Default value is false
Example: boolean one = true
char
char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character
Minimum value is '\u0000' (or 0)
Maximum value is '\uffff' (or 65,535 inclusive)
Char data type is used to store any character
Example: char letterA = 'A'
Reference Datatypes
Reference variables are created using defined constructors of the classes. They are used to access objects. These variables are declared to be of a specific type that cannot be changed. For example, Employee, Puppy, etc.

Class objects and various type of array variables come under reference datatype.

Default value of any reference variable is null.

A reference variable can be used to refer any object of the declared type or any compatible type.

Example: Animal animal = new Animal("giraffe");

Java Literals
A literal is a source code representation of a fixed value. They are represented directly in the code without any computation.

Literals can be assigned to any primitive type variable. For example −

byte a = 68;
char a = 'A';
byte, int, long, and short can be expressed in decimal(base 10), hexadecimal(base 16) or octal(base 8) number systems as well.

Prefix 0 is used to indicate octal, and prefix 0x indicates hexadecimal when using these number systems for literals. For example −

int decimal = 100;
int octal = 0144;
int hexa =  0x64;
String literals in Java are specified like they are in most other languages by enclosing a sequence of characters between a pair of double quotes. Examples of string literals are −

Example
"Hello World"
"two\nlines"
"\"This is in quotes\""
String and char types of literals can contain any Unicode characters. For example −

char a = '\u0001';
String a = "\u0001";
          </pre>
        </div>

        <div id="section7" class="sec">
            <h2>Java - Variable Types </h2>
          <pre>
              A variable provides us with named storage that our programs can manipulate. Each variable in Java has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the set of operations that can be applied to the variable.

You must declare all variables before they can be used. Following is the basic form of a variable declaration −

data type variable [ = value][, variable [ = value] ...] ;
Here data type is one of Java's datatypes and variable is the name of the variable. To declare more than one variable of the specified type, you can use a comma-separated list.

Following are valid examples of variable declaration and initialization in Java −

Example
int a, b, c;         // Declares three ints, a, b, and c.
int a = 10, b = 10;  // Example of initialization
byte B = 22;         // initializes a byte type variable B.
double pi = 3.14159; // declares and assigns a value of PI.
char a = 'a';        // the char variable a iis initialized with value 'a'
This chapter will explain various variable types available in Java Language. There are three kinds of variables in Java −

Local variables
Instance variables
Class/Static variables
Local Variables
Local variables are declared in methods, constructors, or blocks.

Local variables are created when the method, constructor or block is entered and the variable will be destroyed once it exits the method, constructor, or block.

Access modifiers cannot be used for local variables.

Local variables are visible only within the declared method, constructor, or block.

Local variables are implemented at stack level internally.

There is no default value for local variables, so local variables should be declared and an initial value should be assigned before the first use.

Example
Here, age is a local variable. This is defined inside pupAge() method and its scope is limited to only this method.

Live Demo
public class Test {
   public void pupAge() {
      int age = 0;
      age = age + 7;
      System.out.println("Puppy age is : " + age);
   }

   public static void main(String args[]) {
      Test test = new Test();
      test.pupAge();
   }
}
          </pre>
      </div>
      <div id="section8" class="sec">
        <h2>Java - Modifier Types</h2>
          <pre>
            Modifiers are keywords that you add to those definitions to change their meanings. Java language has a wide variety of modifiers, including the following −

Java Access Modifiers

Non Access Modifiers

To use a modifier, you include its keyword in the definition of a class, method, or variable. The modifier precedes the rest of the statement, as in the following example.

Example
public class className {
   // ...
}

private boolean myFlag;
static final double weeks = 9.5;
protected static final int BOXWIDTH = 42;

public static void main(String[] arguments) {
   // body of method
}
Access Control Modifiers
Java provides a number of access modifiers to set access levels for classes, variables, methods and constructors. The four access levels are −

Visible to the package, the default. No modifiers are needed.
Visible to the class only (private).
Visible to the world (public).
Visible to the package and all subclasses (protected).
Non-Access Modifiers
Java provides a number of non-access modifiers to achieve many other functionality.

The static modifier for creating class methods and variables.

The final modifier for finalizing the implementations of classes, methods, and variables.

The abstract modifier for creating abstract classes and methods.

The synchronized and volatile modifiers, which are used for threads.

          <div>Java is a high-level programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems and released in 1995. Java runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. This tutorial gives a complete understanding of Java. This reference will take you through simple and practical approaches while learning Java Programming language.</div>
          <h2>Why to Learn java Programming?</h2>
          <div>Java is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Java Programming:

            Object Oriented − In Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.

            Platform Independent − Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.

            Simple − Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.

            Secure − With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.

            Architecture-neutral − Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.

            Portable − Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable. Compiler in Java is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.

            Robust − Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.</div>
            <h2>Hello World using Java Programming.</h2>
          <div>Just to give you a little excitement about Java programming, I'm going to give you a small conventional C Programming Hello World program, You can try it using Demo link.</div>
          <pre>
              public class MyFirstJavaProgram {
                /* This is my first java program.
                * This will print 'Hello World' as the output
                */

               public static void main(String []args) {
                  System.out.println("Hello World"); // prints Hello World
               }
            }
